Immediate Value Generator / Branch Address Generator
This circuit contains the immediate value generator and the branch address 
generator. As their names would imply, the immediate value generator takes data 
from memory and creates the 32-bit immediate values of 5 of the different 
instruction types (U, I, S, J, B). The branch address generator creates the 
addresses that will be loaded into the program counter after a branch/jump 
instruction.
