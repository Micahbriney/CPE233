LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell fsm/count[3]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) cntr/count_reg[0]/CLR, cntr/count_reg[1]/CLR, cntr/count_reg[2]/CLR, cntr/count_reg[3]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
